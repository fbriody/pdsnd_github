### Project Title
Rideshare Project

### Description
An analysis of three questions using rideshare data from Chicago, New York City and Washington DC. Answered questions are:
1. Is there an association between the number of rentals and the day of the week?
2. Is there an association between birth year, gender and number of rentals for New York and Chicago?
3. Compare the number of one way versus round trip rentals at each starting location in Chicago. (OK, not a question but interesting nonetheless.)

### Files used
Data files are *chicago.csv*, *new_york_city.csv* and *washington.csv*.

### Credits
